# Visual Style Test Update Summary

## What Changed

### 1. **From Style Names to Visual Attributes**
Instead of checking if the LLM applied "Body Text (10/12)" style (which it can't know), we now check if it:
- Used 10pt font size with 12pt leading
- Applied the correct font family (Times, Univers, or TT2020Base)
- Set proper alignment (left, center)
- Added correct indentation

### 2. **Complete Typography Mapping**
The test case now includes 9 distinct text regions with different visual formatting:
- **Headline**: 26pt Univers Bold, centered
- **Body Text**: 10pt Times, with and without first-line indent
- **Quotes**: 10pt TT2020Base, with various indentations
- **Footer/Page Number**: 10pt TT2020Base

### 3. **Font Fallbacks**
Recognizing that specific fonts may not be available:
```json
"fontFallbacks": {
  "Univers LT Std": ["Helvetica", "Arial"],
  "Times NR Seven MT Std": ["Times New Roman", "Times"],
  "TT2020Base": ["Courier New", "Courier"]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **LLM Attempts Recreation**: Looking at the reference image, tries to recreate the layout
2. **Extract Visual Attributes**: Instead of style names, we extract actual formatting
3. **Compare Visual Hierarchy**: Check if the LLM:
   - Recognized the large centered headline
   - Distinguished body text from quotes (different fonts)
   - Applied proper indentation patterns
   - Maintained consistent formatting within sections

## What This Tests

- **Visual Recognition**: Can the LLM see that quotes use a different font than body text?
- **Hierarchy Understanding**: Does it recognize the headline is bigger and centered?
- **Detail Attention**: Does it notice indentation variations?
- **Font Selection**: Can it choose appropriate fonts based on visual characteristics?

## Benefits

1. **More Realistic**: Tests what an LLM can actually observe and recreate
2. **No Magic Knowledge**: Doesn't require knowing your specific style names
3. **Flexible Validation**: Accepts reasonable font substitutions
4. **Actionable Results**: Shows exactly which visual elements were missed

This approach tests the LLM's ability to recreate visual design, not its ability to guess naming conventions.
