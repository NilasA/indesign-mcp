# Decision Analysis Implementation Fixes Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Eliminated Code Duplication** ✓
- Created `extendscript-templates.ts` with shared ExtendScript generation
- Removed ~200 lines of duplicated code between `extract_layout_metrics` and `compare_to_reference`
- Both tools now use the same template for consistency

### 2. **Improved JSON Generation** ✓
- Replaced error-prone string concatenation with array-based JSON building
- Used `JSON.stringify()` for proper escaping of text content
- Made the ExtendScript more robust and maintainable

### 3. **Added Font Fallbacks to Schema** ✓
- Added `fontFallbacks` as proper typed field in Zod schema
- Type: `z.record(z.string(), z.array(z.string()))`
- Removed the `as any` cast that was used before

### 4. **Implemented Response Parsing** ✓
- Added proper parsing methods in test-runner.js:
  - `parseMetricsResult`: Extracts metrics from MCP response text
  - `parseComparisonResult`: Parses comparison results with score and deviations
  - `parseDecisionLog`: Extracts decision entries from formatted text
- Handles both JSON and formatted text responses

### 5. **Fixed TypeScript Issues** ✓
- Fixed template variable scoping issues
- Resolved TypeScript narrowing issue with `current.textRegions`
- All code now compiles without errors

### 6. **Added Pattern Detection** ✓
- Test runner now detects visual attribute patterns:
  - `font-selection`: Wrong font choices
  - `text-sizing`: Incorrect sizes  
  - `text-alignment`: Alignment errors
- Generates targeted recommendations based on patterns

### 7. **Created Integration Test** ✓
- Simple test verifies all 4 analysis tools are registered
- Can be extended to test with actual InDesign connection

## What Still Needs Work

### 1. **MCP Client Connection**
- The SDK client imports have compatibility issues
- May need to use a different approach or update dependencies

### 2. **End-to-End Testing**
- Need to test with actual MCP client (Claude, etc.)
- Verify the visual attributes extraction works with real documents

### 3. **Error Handling Enhancement**
- Add more specific error messages for common failures
- Better handling of edge cases (empty documents, missing fonts)

## How to Test

1. **Verify Registration**:
   ```bash
   node test-analysis-simple.js
   ```

2. **Start MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Use with MCP Client**:
   - Connect your MCP client to the server
   - Call the analysis tools:
     - `record_decision` - Track decisions
     - `extract_layout_metrics` - Get visual attributes
     - `compare_to_reference` - Compare layouts
     - `get_decision_log` - Review decisions

## Key Improvements

The implementation is now:
- **DRY**: No duplicated ExtendScript code
- **Type-safe**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
- **Testable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Maintainable**: Cleaner JSON generation
- **Actionable**: Pattern detection provides specific recommendations

The visual attributes approach successfully tests what LLMs can observe rather than expecting them to guess style names.
